Description
-----------

trac-remote allows command-line manipulation of Trac_ instances,
similar to trac-admin, but does not require physical, console
access to the Trac_ data.

History
-------

Portions of the back-end Python library were developed in the
SDSS-III_ `svn repository`_.  The present location of
the repository is http://github.com/weaverba137/trac-remote .
